== Description ==

Before and After Gallery displays a thumbnail gallery with a draggable control to scrub between before and after images. Using shortcodes you can either create a link to the gallery or display a thumbnail image which links to the gallery. The gallery will pop up in a lightbox and has previous and next buttons to navigate though image sets as well as paged thumbnail previews.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I first need to upload the images through WordPress's media library manually? =

No. The Before and After Gallery settings area provides a shortcut to the media library for uploading and selecting images for use in the gallery.

= Will the images be automatically resized? =

The images are resized using CSS by default (thumbnail images are responsively resized.) However, when selecting the image from the media library, you should choose the size appropriate for your design.
